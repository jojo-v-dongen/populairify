# populairify
A website to explore and suggest music from unpopular artists. <br>
Currently still under development, coming soon!

## What is Populairify?
Populairify is a non-profit web platform that aims to benefit music listeners and creators alike. By creating an account, users gain access to a database of randomly generated, "unpopular" songs by emerging artists on Spotify. By listening to and voting on these tracks, users can discover new music and support independent artists in gaining exposure and recognition. Populairify offers a unique alternative to mainstream music streaming services, providing a valuable resource for music enthusiasts seeking to expand their musical horizons.

Furthermore, Populairify creates a leaderboard of the highest-ranked songs based on user votes. This allows other users to easily find and enjoy the most popular tracks, contributing to a community-driven approach to music discovery. Through your participation and voting, you are not only discovering great new music but also contributing to a platform that supports the growth of emerging artists. Join us today and start exploring the diverse world of "unpopular" music!

## Why did I create this website?
As a music enthusiast, I wanted to explore new music beyond what popular artists and mainstream streaming services offered. However, I found that Spotify's suggestions tended to feature well-known artists, leaving smaller artists with little opportunity to gain recognition. To address this issue, I began generating random songs that were considered "unpopular" and was pleasantly surprised to find that I discovered many great new tracks that I wouldn't have found otherwise. Encouraged by my success, I created Populairify, a website that allows other music enthusiasts to listen to and vote on these "unpopular" songs, thereby supporting smaller artists and expanding their own musical horizons.

## Suggesting songs:
Populairify encourages users to suggest songs on our voting page. You can suggest a song by simply pasting the Spotify track URL in the form provided, this is the same url someone would use to share a song with a friend. After submission, your suggested song will be added to a separate suggestion database for review. Our review process takes a maximum of one day.

Please note that while we welcome suggestions for tracks from new or emerging artists, we do not accept suggestions for songs from popular mainstream artists such as Taylor Swift or Drake. The goal of our website is to introduce users to new and unheard-of music. However, we still encourage you to submit your songs, even if you think they might not make the cut. There is no penalty for submitting a suggestion that is not accepted, so please feel free to share your favorite tracks with the community.

When a user is voting and a song suggested by another user appears, it will be labeled with "[This song was suggested by a user]" at the bottom of the page. The identity of the user who suggested the song will remain anonymous for privacy reasons.

By suggesting songs, you can share your favorite music with the Populairify community and help others discover new songs. We believe that this community is essential in creating a diverse and vibrant music database. So why not join us today and start sharing your favorite music with the world? Who knows, your suggested song might end up on our leaderboard.

## Frequently asked questions:
### Why is the website named "populairify"?
The name of our website, Populairify, reflects our goal of helping small music creators gain popularity and exposure. Originally, the site was intended to be in Dutch, and "populair" is the Dutch spelling for "popular." However, we decided to create the website in English to reach a wider audience, as most people in the Netherlands are proficient in English. Despite the name, our mission remains the same: to support emerging artists and provide users with an opportunity to discover great new music.

### Why is it necessary to register an account on our website?
We require all users to create an account on Populairify to ensure that you don't come across the same song multiple times while voting. To accomplish this, we had two choices: either use cookies to keep track of which songs you've already voted for or use an online database. We chose the database option because it allows users to pick up where they left off, regardless of the device they're using. Cookies are only saved on one device.
